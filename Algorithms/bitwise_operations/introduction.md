# Bitwise Operations

#### What is bitwise operations?

Bitwise is a level of operation that involves working with individual bits which are the smallest units of data in a computing system. Each bit has a single binary value of 0 or 1. Most programming languages manipulate groups of 8, 16 or 32 bits. These bit multiples are known as bytes.

The arithmetic logic unit ([ALU](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/arithmetic-logic-unit-ALU)) is a part of a computer's [CPU](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/processor). Inside the ALU, mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are all done at bit level. For those operations, bitwise operators are used.
