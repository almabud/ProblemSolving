### **Given a set of N objects.**&#x20;

**・ Union command:** connect two objects.&#x20;

**・ Find/connected query:** is there a path connecting the two objects?

In the above, we need to find any path of the two given objects.

This seems to be a little problem and can be answered in a minute for a human. But for bigger type problems like the need to find the path in the network hub. eg. is there any path from **p to q**?

This is huge and we need a computer program to solve this type of problem.&#x20;
